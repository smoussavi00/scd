**A scheduling application implementation primarily through C (Work in Progress) **

NOTES:
1. For the format of base files check the samples in 'base' as references - and edit them as necessary  <br />
  1.1 Eventually an interface will handle creation and deletion of schedule items  <br />
  1.2 (IMPORTANT) If you add and remove any items, be sure to update the corresponding count value in 'total/count'  <br />
  1.3 Anything of the format ::XYZ is a modifier for the previous entry  <br />
  1.4 The first two digits in an entry in the 'primary' base is duration in 30 minute time blocks (e.g. 03 is 90 minutes)  <br />
   
2. For now you can only view today's items  <br />
  2.1 Eventually an interface will handle the viewing of different days
